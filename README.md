# Median-Filter
Implementation of median filter in python to remove noise from grayscale images.

Median Filtering is a digital filtering technique, used to remove noise from an image. This type of filtering can be a pre-processing step for further processing like object/edge detection. Detailed explanation of median filter can be found here (http://blog.savanvisalpara.com/median-filter.html)

#Run
Dependency for this script is python 2.7, numpy and scipy. To run,
**python medain.py input.jpg output.jpg 3/5 **
where 3/5 shows filter size, it could be 3 or 5. 



Please note, this is not an optimal implementation. My intent is to focus on procedure, how median filtering works. Fast execution can be achieved with another implementations.
